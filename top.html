  <h2>Benchmark Games for Gerbil, Racket, Go, and C (GCC)</h2>
  <p> I run the tests with Gerbil, and compared with Racket, Go, and C.
    The Gerbil programs are new, for the others I used the existing (expertly written and heavily optimized) programs from the <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html">23.03 Benchmarks Game</a>, but see notes below.
  <p> Versions used: <b>Gerbil v0.18</b>, <b>Racket v8.6</b>, <b>Go 1.21.2</b>, and <b>GCC 11.4</b>
  <p>The source code for the benchmark game is <a href="https://github.com/vyzo/lisp-benchmarks-game/">here</a>.


  <p>The benchmarks were run on a Dell XPS 13-9320 laptop.
  <p>Each benchmark was run 3 times, and I kept the best value.
  <p><b>Note</b> C programs were compiled with <code>gcc -O2</code>.
  <p><b>Note</b> The benchmark all utilize a <b>single core</b>. I want to compare apples to apples, not how well a given language can multicore. Gerbil is also multicore capable, but the SMP backend is not stable yet; when it is, it will be time for Gerbil v1.0.
    <br>
    For C, I kept the fastest versions that don't utilize architecture specific extensions, as these are not generally portable and don't even compile on my laptop. I want reproducible benchmarks, not something bogus that relies on a specific Intel chip.
    That means that <b>there may exist faster C programs out there</b>, but they may or may not compile and run on any given machine, so I opted to stay portable.
  <p><b>Note</b>This is not a d*ck swinging contest. I compiled these results to see
    how far I can push Gerbil's performance envelope and evaluate progress as the macrology/compiler improves.
    Take them with a grain of salt.
